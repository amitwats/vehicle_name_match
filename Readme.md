## Installation

The following are in prerequisites
* Python (v 11 and above) is installed

The master data of the vehicles and its listings is in a postgres db. In order to run this I am using a docker image.

## Running in DB Docker

### Build the container

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t autograb_postgres .
```
  
### Run the image

```bash
docker run -d --name autograb_db_container -p 5432:5432 autograb_postgres
```
This should have the DB up and running with the required data.
